# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description
Code refactoring for editing and cleaning up previously written software code.
Replacing all the 'div' elements in HTML
with 'semantic' elements. The 'div' is the least rank of the element. I need to put id on the 'search-engine-optimization'to make the page can scrool down when we touch it. I put 'alt' to the image, in case if the image is does not load we know what the contact is and for blind people if they use the screen reader they know what is the image mean. I change the class:'social' inside the 'section' and class:'benefit' inside the 'aside'.Also for completing CSS with grouping class="social" and class="benefit" This is key in reducing technical cost since it's better to clean up the code now than pay for costly errors later and for the accessibility of a computer system to all people.
